Welcome to LeaseHub! Our platform revolutionizes real estate management by allowing property owners to tokenize their assets, providing a flexible way to manage ownership and generate income.

## Project Overview

LeaseHub aims to offer a new approach to property management for owners and a unique accommodation experience for travel enthusiasts.

## For Property Owners

- **Rent Out Properties**: List your properties for rent and earn rental income.
- **Tokenize Assets**: Sell partial ownership of your property as tokens to gain liquidity in SOL (Solana).
- **Delist Properties**: Remove your property from the platform if you own all tokens.

## For Token Holders

- **Earn Rental Income**: Receive a share of the rental income proportional to your token ownership.
- **Trade Tokens**: Sell your property tokens to gain liquidity in SOL.

## For Travelers

- **Stake SOL**: Both regular users and property owners can stake SOL to earn reward tokens.
- **Book Accommodations**: Use earned reward tokens to pay for property rentals.

## For Investors

- **Purchase Property Tokens**: Invest in desirable properties by buying tokens using SOL.
